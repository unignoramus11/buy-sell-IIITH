# Buy-Sell@IIITH 🛍️

Welcome to Buy-Sell@IIITH - where IIIT Hyderabad's students turn their pre-loved treasures into someone else's next favorite thing! Check out our live site at [bs-iiith.vercel.app](http://bs-iiith.vercel.app/).

> **Note**: The chatbot features are limited on the deployed version because, well, I am a student and AI tokens aren't cheap! 💸 (Sorry, but I'd rather spend that money on midnight fried maggi)

## Getting Started 🚀

### Installation & Setup

#### 1. Environment Setup

First things first, let's get those environment variables in order:

- Navigate to both `frontend/` and `backend/` directories
- Copy the `.env.example` files to create your `.env` files
- Fill in the values (don't worry, I've left helpful hints!)

#### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend/
npm install     # Installs the dependencies
npm run build   # Builds the application
npm run start   # Launches the backend server
```

#### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend/
npm install     # Installs the dependencies
npm run build   # Builds the application
npm run start   # Launches the frontend server
```
